# Description

This contains all the notes that I use in teaching Math 120R at the University of Arizona.  They are are written in Latex and use the tufte handout layout. You are free to use them as you please.  If you make serious changes to the documents, consider pushing them to me and let me incorporate them into the original documents.  That way they get better and better.

# *Important Information*

I used overleaf to generate the pdf files (which are not included) and I noticed that I didn't need to include the tufte handout style sheets in order to compile them.  **That might be different for you**.  If you have any problems you can post a comment on github and I can help you.  If you are really nice I can even put all right documents for you in all the files (using some bash script or something).
